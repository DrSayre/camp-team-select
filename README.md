This is an app to select a random "team" (or more simply a number 1-4) and display the result by using a video clip from the "Wheel of Morality" scenes of Animaniacs.

This will also keep track of results so that every 4 draws will pick each team once.

I am still tweaking this some, but feel free to fork it and make it suit your own needs.  Create an issue if you want more scenes rather than just 1 to 4.
